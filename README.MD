# Taskbar Blur++ (2019)
A re-write of an old Win32 project of mine. This version now runs as a command-line
utility instead of a GUI application. This makes it more suitable as a Windows start-up application
as the performance impact will be reduced significantly.

Please note that this may only work with the Windows <a href="https://glass8.eu">AeroGlass</a>
modification. This was not tested without it.
